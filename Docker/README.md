## Usage

### Installation

Build `dscdashboard` from source:

    git clone https://github.com/fvanroie/DscDashboard.git
    cd DscDashboard
    sudo docker build -t dscdashboard -f Docker/Dockerfile .

If the build succeeded, you will see:

    Successfully built <imageid>
    Successfully tagged dscdashboard:latest

### Run

Run the image, binding associated ports and SQL Server connection string:

    docker run -p 8080:80 --env DSC_SQL='SERVER=<hostname>; Uid=<user>; Pwd=<password>' dscdashboard

Change the `<hostname>`, `<readuser>` and `<password>` in the `DSC_SQL` to the appropriate values to
connect to the DSC database on the SQL Server. This should be a temporary *read-only* account on the DSC database
for testing purposes.

The DSC Dashboard module only uses SELECT queries and does not modify the database.

You can also set the `DSC_SQL` environment variable inside the Dockerfile and rebuild the image.
