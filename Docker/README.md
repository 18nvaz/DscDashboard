## Usage

### Installation

To build `dscdashboard` from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fvanroie/DscDashboard.git
cd DscDashboard
sudo docker build -t dscdashboard -f Docker/Dockerfile .
```

If the build succeeded, you will see:

    Successfully built <imageid>
    Successfully tagged dscdashboard:latest


### Test

Test the newly built image, bind associated public port and provide a SQL Server connection string:

```bash
docker run -rm -p 8080:80 -e DSC_SQL='SERVER=<hostname>; Uid=<user>; Pwd=<password>' --name dsc dscdashboard
```

Change the `<hostname>`, `<user>` and `<password>` in the `DSC_SQL` argument to the appropriate values to
connect to the DSC database on the SQL Server. This should be a temporary *read-only* account on the DSC database
for testing purposes.

You can also set the `DSC_SQL` environment variable by editing the Dockerfile and rebuilding the image.


After a little while you should see this message:

    Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:80
    Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.

Browse to the http://<ipaddress:port> to test the DSC Dashboard. Press Ctrl-C to stop the website and exit the container when done testing.
